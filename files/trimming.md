### Exclusive of Trimming
I receive one e-mail this evening, and the content as below: 

Hi Scott,<br>
<p>Our factory has suggested we will need “Exclusive of Trimming” after the Shell and its contents in order to pass testing.
We will need this revision today, we apologize for any inconvenience. Hopefully this will be the last change.</p>
Thanks,<br>

<p>I am confused about Exclusive of Trimming so I ask my boss Chris for help. He invite me to his office and search pillow of 
trimming and then curtain with trimming with [bing](https://cn.bing.com/images/search?q=curtain+of+trimming&FORM=HDRSC2).
Suddenly, i got it.</p>
So if you are misunderstood with something, just use bing.
